## VeChain Sync2 
 **Sync2** is designed to work with all mainstream web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Safari, MS Edge, Firefox, etc), desktop and mobile device.

 The main advantage and purpose of Sync 2 is the massive simplification of dApps and dApp usage. All editions of Sync 2, no matter whether the native app built for desktop or mobile, or the automatically invoked SPA version, are designed to appear and function pretty much in the same way, therefore providing a consistent and comfortable user experience for users across different OS and devices.
